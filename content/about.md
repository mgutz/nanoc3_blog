## Thanks

Thanks to everyone in the
[nanoc group](http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc)
for sample code.

Thanks to [Denis Defreyne](http://stoneship.org/about/), author of nanoc.

I tried [other compilers](http://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/static_website_generation.html)
and chose nanoc3 for its architecture.
